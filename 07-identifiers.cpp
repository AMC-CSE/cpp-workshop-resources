/*
    All C++ variables must be identified with unique names.

    These unique names are called identifiers.
*/

//Example

int minutesPerHour = 60;
int m = 60;


/*
- Names can contain letters, digits and underscores
- Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_)
- Names are case sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables)
- Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.
- Reserved words (like C++ keywords, such as int) cannot be used as names
