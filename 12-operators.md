## C++ Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

## Example

```cpp
int x = 100 + 50;
```

## Arithmetic Operators

**Operator name** | **name** | **Description** | **Example** |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
| + | addition | Adds together two values | x+y |
| - | subtraction | Subtracts one value from another | x-y |
| * | multiplication | Multiplies two values | x*y |
| / | division | Divides one value by another | x/y |
| % | modulus | Returns the division remainder | x%y |
| ++ | increment | Increases the value of a variable by 1 | ++x |
| -- | decrement | Decreases the value of a variable by 1 | --x |

## Assignment Operators

**Operator** | **Example** |
--- | --- |
| = | x = 5 |
| += | x += 5 |
| -= | x -= 5 |
| *= | x *= 5 |
| /= | x /= 5 |
| %= | x %= 5 |
| &= | x &= 5 |
| |= | x |= 5 |
| ^= | x ^= 5 |
| >>= | x >>= 5 |
| <<= | x <<= 5 |

## Comparison Operators

**Operator** | **Name** | **Example** |
--- | --- | --- |
| == | Equal to | x == y |
| != | Not Equal To | x != y |
| > | Greater than | x > y |
| < | Less than | x < y |
| >= | Greater than or equal to | x >= y |
| <= | Less than or equal to | x <= y |

## Logical Operators

**Operator** | **Name** | **Example** |
--- | --- | --- |
| && | Logical and | x && y |
| two pipelines | Logical or | x || y |
| ! | Logical not | !(x && y) |
